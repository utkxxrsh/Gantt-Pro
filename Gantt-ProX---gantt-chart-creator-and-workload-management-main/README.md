Project Title - GanttProX

ABSTRACT
❖Project management includes defining, planning, managing and controlling
the workload between various people in the development team for the proper
completion of any project or task. It is important to recognize that all projects
need some level of project management. The larger and more complex the
project, the more there is a need for a formal, standard, structured process.
Smaller projects still need a structured process, but it does not need to be as
elaborate or as complex. Obviously, there is a cost to the effort associated
with project management, but there are many benefits that are obtained as
well.
❖Our software Gantt ProX is designed to provide the fundamental structure
you need to develop a successful project, including a step-by-step approach,
starting with the basics and getting as sophisticated as you need for your
particular project. Gantt ProX is a flexible and scalable software for
managing the workload as a project manager. The basic philosophy is “large
workload distribution for large projects and small workload distribution for
small projects”. Gantt ProX shows you what you need to know to manage
projects of all size, ranging from the basic task scheduling to the complex
gantt chart.
❖The software Gantt ProX contains two major views. One view is based on
the Project Manager module which incorporates showing important tasks,
setting up the workload, managing the team and most importantly viewing
the progress of the project. Each process is described from beginning to end
with all the start and end dates. The second view is based on the Project Team
module where the same content is mapped into the assigned tasks and status
of each task to administer the progress of individuals by the manager
